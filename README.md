## Simple Login App

This is an application with a React front-end and a Node.js back-end, that is used to simply perform a login capability. You can log in to see user details, log out and create your own new user. 
The purpose of this project is to serve as a template for use later, as well as practice for the React and Node.js technologies.

A live sample of this application(hosted on the free sample of Heroku) can be found [here](https://lesasi-simple-login-app.herokuapp.com/). It make take a while to startup on first loading the website since its the free tier. Also, since the point of this project is for practice, not much effort went into design, since I kind of suck at design anyway
